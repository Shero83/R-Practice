## R-Practice

These are the R files I wrote for the "Data Driven Decision Making" Class at NYU Stern. Usually I'd prep the data using R, then visualize it using Tableau. I had to exclude the data files (except for my final project) because of the file size limit on Github. 

If you examine the code and are interested in its data, please contact me and I'd be happy to provide it.

Cheers!
